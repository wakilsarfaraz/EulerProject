## Documentation
This directory presents MATLAB coded solutions to questions from Euler Project on https://projecteuler.net/.
The code can be directly downloaded and run to obtain the answer. Solutions to questions on Euler Project can be found in many different ways, therefore, it should not be a shock to see a completely different approach that is attempted here and yet returns the right answer. So far 10 questions are solved, but the directory will continue to get updated as more solutions are uploaded. The piece of code for a particular question is self explanatory in the format of the word 'EuPr' followed by a number that corresponds to the number of question in the Euler Project website.
